 🕸️ Project Auditor Swarm – JuliaOS AI Agent DApp

A minimal AI-powered dApp built for the **Agents of the Permaweb Hackathon**, using the **JuliaOS framework**.

It simulates a swarm of AI agents that audit any Solana token or project name, analyzing:

- 📡 **Social Sentiment**
- 🔗 **On-Chain Data**
- ⚠️ **Rug Risk Level**
- ✅ **Final Audit Score**

---

## 🧠 What It Does

Users enter a Solana token address or project name. The swarm of agents performs a full audit in the browser, showing results with a typing animation.

✅ **No backend**. Fully on-chain data.  
✅ Built with just **HTML, CSS, and JS**.  
✅ Uses `solscan.io` API to fetch real token data.  
✅ Simulated AI logic for sentiment and rug detection.  
✅ Optimized for low-power AI use (bonus point #3).
